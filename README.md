The program implements 4 AI agents to solve the Sliding Bricks Puzzle using four different search algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), 
Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) and A*. In the directory **SBP-levels**, there are text files containing
SBP problems with different difficulty levels. To solve a puzzle with each agent, use the following commands:

BFS:
```
sh run.sh bfs <filename>
```

DFS:
```
sh run.sh dfs <filename>
```

IDS:
```
sh run.sh ids <filename>
```

A*: 
```
sh run.sh astar <filename>
```
